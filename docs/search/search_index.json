How do geographers use this information to interpret changes in the global environment across space and time? In this course we will learn how to work with large geographic datasets to explore patterns and changes to the Earth\u2019s surface at local to global scales. Case studies will use remotely-sensed images to study land cover, climate, weather, wildfire, and other topics. Students will learn concepts, methods, and ethics for using a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform to process data, critically interpret workflows and results, and communicate findings with web maps and graphics.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"Your final grade will be based on your participation in the course, two problem sets , and two research stories . COMPONENT EXPECTATIONS WEIGHT Participation Attend all class meetings, complete all lab exercises, participate in all crits, meet all deadlines. Provide prior notice if you must miss a meeting or need extra time on a task. Step penalty (e.g. A becomes A-) on problem set or story grade for each infraction. Problem sets Work out complete, correct solutions. 25% each Research stories Develop a study plan, conduct analysis, present findings visually and verbally, seek help when you need it, meet crit deadline, incorporate peer feedback in final revision. 25% each","title":"Final grade"},{"location":"outcomes/","text":"By the end of this course, you should be able to: select and manipulate geographic images with Earth Engine\u2019s javascript code editor define and apply concepts of remote sensing and geospatial analysis solve and trouble-shoot image processing workflows illustrate and interpret visual evidence of environmental change with words and pictures","title":"Outcomes"},{"location":"policies/","text":"Academic Integrity As an academic community devoted to the life of the mind, Middlebury requires of every student complete intellectual honesty in the preparation and submission of all academic work. Details of our Academic Honesty, Honor Code, and Related Disciplinary Policies are available in Middlebury\u2019s handbook . Honor Code Pledge The Honor Code pledge reads as follows: \u201cI have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.\u201d Please adhere to it and sign the Honor Code pledge on all problem sets. Accommodations Students who have Letters of Accommodation in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. For those without Letters of Accommodation, assistance is available to eligible students through the Disability Resource Center. Please contact ADA Coordinators Jodi Litchfield and Peter Ploegman in the DRC at ada@middlebury.edu for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.","title":"Policies"},{"location":"problemSets/","text":"Each problem set will consist of an independent and a collaborative phase: PHASE RULES Independent You will have 2 \u00bd hours to independently work out solutions to a small set of problems. You are not authorized to discuss the problems with peers. You may refer to your own notes and your previous work in the course, and you may ask the professor for clarity, but you may not discuss the problems with anyone else. Collaborative You will have an additional two days to finish solving the problems. Your final solutions are due the first Thursday by 5pm. You are authorized and encouraged to talk with instructors or peers in the class. Each problem in the set will be graded based on your ability to work out solutions independently or with assistance: GRADE POINTS SOLUTION A 4 Complete and correct solution by end of independent phase. B 3 One or more correct parts of a solution that contains one or more errors by end of independent phase. Complete and correct solution by end of collaborative phase. C 2 No correct parts of the solution by end of independent phase. Complete and correct solution by end of collaborative phase. F 0 Failure to complete or correct solution by end of collaborative phase without discussing extra time with the professor. Letter grades will be the average of the three scores. This is the grade scale in the Middlebury Handbook . GRADE POINTS A 4.00 A- 3.67 B+ 3.33 B 3.00 B- 2.67 C+ 2.33 C 2.00 C- 1.67 D+ 1.33 D 1.00 D- 0.67 F 0.00","title":"Problem sets"},{"location":"researchStory/","text":"For each story, you will apply one or more methods from this course to investigate a topic of environmental change, customize an interactive web map, and write a short (~750 word) narrative with illustrations and references. Your first story will apply methods for visualizing images that we learn in the first half of the course. Your second story will apply methods for computing indices or other derivatives from imagery that we learn in the second half of the course. Stories from NASA Earth Observatory provide good examples of research stories that you should explore for ideas (for example) . Your research must employ a comparative approach. This means that of the three dimensions of geographic information (space, time, theme), you will control two dimensions (making them the same) so that you can compare and contrast across a third dimension. STUDY TYPE Region Time period Thematic layer Compare same theme at same time period across two or more different regions \u2260 = = Compare same region and same theme at two or more different time periods = \u2260 = Compare two or more different themes at same region and same time period = = \u2260 Each story will be graded based on qualities of three different components and each component will be weighted equally. COMPONENT GRADING CRITERIA Study design Depth: Strong choice and justification of topic(s), study site(s), time period(s), and data source(s). Solution Depth: Strong use of methods to produce an efficient solution. Documentation: Clearly commented code to support review and reuse. Bug-free: Runs without errors. Presentation Depth : Strong interpretations, not just descriptions. Research: Strong background and ancillary references. Illustrative: Shows and tells. Polish: Strong verbal and visual communication.","title":"Research stories"}]}
