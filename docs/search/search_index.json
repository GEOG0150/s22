Details of our Academic Honesty, Honor Code, and Related Disciplinary Policies are available in Middlebury\u2019s handbook . Honor Code Pledge The Honor Code pledge reads as follows: \u201cI have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.\u201d Please adhere to it and sign the Honor Code pledge on all problem sets. Accommodations Students who have Letters of Accommodation in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. For those without Letters of Accommodation, assistance is available to eligible students through the Disability Resource Center. Please contact ADA Coordinators Jodi Litchfield and Peter Ploegman in the DRC at ada@middlebury.edu for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.","title":"College"},{"location":"description/","text":"How do geographers use geospatial technologies to observe the Earth\u2019s surface? How do geographers use this information to interpret changes in the global environment across space and time? In this course we will learn how to work with large geographic datasets to explore patterns and changes to the Earth\u2019s surface at local to global scales. Case studies will use remotely-sensed images to study land cover, climate, weather, wildfire, and other topics. Students will learn concepts, methods, and ethics for using a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform to process data, critically interpret workflows and results, and communicate findings with web maps and graphics.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"Your final grade will be based on your participation in the course, two problem sets , and two research stories .

You are not authorized to discuss the problems with peers. You may refer to your own notes and your previous work in the course, and you may ask the professor for clarity, but you may not discuss the problems with anyone else. Collaborative You will have an additional two days to finish solving the problems. Your final solutions are due the first Thursday by 5pm. You are authorized and encouraged to talk with instructors or peers in the class. Each problem in the set will be graded based on your ability to work out solutions independently or with assistance: GRADE POINTS SOLUTION A 4 Complete and correct solution by end of independent phase. B 3 One or more correct parts of a solution that contains one or more errors by end of independent phase. Complete and correct solution by end of collaborative phase. C 2 No correct parts of the solution by end of independent phase, but all parts correct and complete by end of collaborative phase. Or some incorrect parts of the solution by end of independent phase and failure to correct all parts by end of collaborative phase. F 0 Failure to submit solution by end of collaborative phase without discussing extra time with the professor. Letter grades will be the average of the three scores. This is the grade scale in the Middlebury Handbook . GRADE POINTS A 4.00 A- 3.67 B+ 3.33 B 3.00 B- 2.67 C+ 2.33 C 2.00 C- 1.67 D+ 1.33 D 1.00 D- 0.67 F 0.00","title":"Problem sets"},{"location":"ps_policies/","text":"Problem set authorizations Honor Code Pledge You will be required to write and sign the honor code when you submit your work on problem sets. \u201cI have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.\u201d Please note that by signing this honor code, you pledge to follow the authorizations described below . You also pledge to not distribute or share any part of the problem set repositories, or any part of the scripts that you develop while solving the problems in the set, with other students outside of the present class at any time. This will allow me to recycle these problems in the future without disadvantaging students in the present. Thank you. Independent phase You will have 2.5 hours to independently solve and submit solutions to three problems. You must submit separate links to each script in the problem set dropbox (this will be demonstrated at the beginning of the problem set). We will start the clock after we have read through the problems together and I have answered any questions. While you work on a problem set, you are authorized to refer to the eePrimer repository, the scripts that you have written previously in this class, and your notes from lecture meetings. You are authorized to communicate with Jeff Howarth while you work on this problem set for questions about clarity and/or language in the problem descriptions. There will be a zoom room open throughout the independent phase and you may join at any time. Otherwise, during the independent phase, you are not authorized to communicate in any way with anyone about the problem set. Collaborative phase You are responsible for solving all three problems and meeting all prompt criteria by the end of the collaborative phase as marked on the syllabus calendar. You must submit revised scripts in the problem set dropbox. Please note: you do not need to re-submit a link to a solution if you solved it correctly in the independent phase. During the collaborative phase, you are authorized and encouraged to talk to instructors and other students in the course about the problems. We will discuss the solutions as a class in our lecture meeting on Wednesday. During the collaborative phase, you may work on problems with peers in this class. You may also discuss any part of any problem with Jeff Howarth or the ASI in our office hours.","title":"Problem sets"},{"location":"researchStory/","text":"For each story, you will apply one or more methods from this course to investigate a topic of environmental change, customize an interactive web map, and write a short (~750 word) narrative with illustrations and references. Your first story will apply methods for visualizing images that we learn in the first half of the course. Your second story will apply methods for computing indices or other derivatives from imagery that we learn in the second half of the course. Stories from NASA Earth Observatory provide good examples of research stories that you should explore for ideas (for example) . Your research must employ a comparative approach. This means that of the three dimensions of geographic information (space, time, theme), you will control two dimensions (making them the same) so that you can compare and contrast across a third dimension. STUDY TYPE Region Time period Thematic layer Compare same theme at same time period across two or more different regions \u2260 = = Compare same region and same theme at two or more different time periods = \u2260 = Compare two or more different themes at same region and same time period = = \u2260 Each story will be graded based on qualities of three different components and each component will be weighted equally. COMPONENT GRADING CRITERIA Study design Depth: Strong choice and justification of topic(s), study site(s), time period(s), and data source(s). Solution Depth: Strong use of methods to produce an efficient solution. Documentation: Clearly commented code to support review and reuse. Bug-free: Runs without errors. Presentation Depth : Strong interpretations, not just descriptions. Research: Strong background and ancillary references. Illustrative: Shows and tells. Polish: Strong verbal and visual communication.","title":"Research stories"}]}
